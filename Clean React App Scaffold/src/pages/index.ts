// DEPRECATED: This barrel export file is no longer used
// Router now imports components directly from their source files
// This file can be safely removed but is kept for reference

// If you need to restore barrel exports in the future, use this structure:
/*
export { default as Overview } from '../../components/Overview';
export { default as GuidelinesViewer } from '../../components/GuidelinesViewer';
export { default as TokensPage } from '../../components/TokensPage';
export { default as ComponentsCatalog } from '../../components/ComponentsCatalog';  
export { default as Diagnostics } from '../../components/Diagnostics';
export { default as Releases } from '../../components/Releases';
export { MiniLayouts } from '../../components/MiniLayouts';  // Named export
*/
